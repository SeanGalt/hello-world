# hello-world
Just my first repository
Hello, everyone. My name is Sean, and I am called an Analyst at work, but my job duties vary so widely that I'm not sure it's an accurate title. I know practically nothing about SQL, but as I live & die in Access at work, and am learning ARCGIS Pro and (soon) Power BI, it it probably time to learn SQL. I've been here nearly 18 years, helping manage a network of aftermarket automotive electronics installers. I too have never used Slack, so I'm bound to mess this up at some point.
Also a Star Wars nerd
2 Boys at home, 6 months and 8 years
married for nearly 25 years, wife teaches art, and we are both chronic MAKERS.
Pottery, decals, 3D printing, you name it, we've probably tried it.
